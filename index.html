    <h2 id="journey">My Coding Journey</h2>

    <figure>
      <p>
        I first discovered coding when I realised I could automate some of my
        manual tasks at work using Excel. I started creating an application
        using formulas and then taught myself some basic VBA to better the
        functionality of it. My interest in coding grew as I began to teach
        myself some Python and C# and realised how much I enjoyed the logical
        and creative aspects of it.<br /><br />
        <!-- tooltip for links -->
        In my most recent job I honed my VBA skills and taught myself SQL in
        order to <a href="#portal" target="_blank">build a system</a> that my
        team members could complete their work using. The system also provides
        MI and KPI statistics for both my team members and the agents they
        monitor, and produces reports for associated teams within the business
        and senior management. It is now the main tool that my business area
        uses for their BAU tasks which I'm incredibly proud of and it continues
        to positively impact the business after I have left.<br /><br />
        Gaining the confidence that I could turn my coding hobby into a career,
        I explored various education options. I decided to apply for a place at
        <a href="https://northcoders.com" target="_blank">Northcoders</a> on the
        advice of the IT recruitment manager at my previous workplace and
        learning what the course involved. I've found Northcoders to be an
        incredibly rewarding experience and I'm amazed at how much I've learnt.
