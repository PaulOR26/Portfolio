    <h2 id="journey">My Coding Journey</h2>
    <figure>
      <p>I first discovered coding when creating an Excel application, starting off using formulas and then teaching myself some basic VBA to better the functionality of it. My interest grew as I started to teach myself Python and C# and realised how much I enjoyed the logical and creative aspects of coding.
        In my most recent job I honed my VBA skills and taught myself SQL in order to <a href="portal">build a system</a> that my team members could complete their work using. The system also provides MI and KPI statistics for both my team members and the agents they monitor, and produces reports for associated teams within the business and senior management. It is now the main tool that my business area uses for their BAU tasks which I'm incredibly proud of and it continues to positively impact the business after I have left.
        Gaining the confidence that I could turn my coding hobby into a career, I explored various education options. I decided to apply for a place at <a href="https://northcoders.com"></a>Northcoders</a> on the advice of the IT recruitment manager at my previous workplace and learning what the course involved. I've found Northcoders to be one of the most rewarding times in my life and I'm amazed at how much I've learnt, and I'm excited to take the next step and begin my software development career.
