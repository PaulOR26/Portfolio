        This project was to build a backend service that provides application
        data to a front end architecture.

        This project was to build a hub for a call centre Quality Assurance team
        where they could mark calls, track performance, produce reports, and
        calibrate internal quality, all in one place replacing the spreadsheets
        they previously used.

    <h2 id="journey">My Coding Journey</h2>

    <figure>
      <p>
        I first discovered coding when creating an Excel application, starting
        off using formulas and then teaching myself some basic VBA to better the
        functionality of it. My interest grew as I started to teach myself
        Python and C# and realised how much I enjoyed the logical and creative
        aspects of coding.<br /><br />
        <!-- tooltip for links -->
        In my most recent job I honed my VBA skills and taught myself SQL in
        order to <a href="#portal" target="_blank">build a system</a> that my
        team members could complete their work using. The system also provides
        MI and KPI statistics for both my team members and the agents they
        monitor, and produces reports for associated teams within the business
        and senior management. It is now the main tool that my business area
        uses for their BAU tasks which I'm incredibly proud of and it continues
        to positively impact the business after I have left.<br /><br />
        Gaining the confidence that I could turn my coding hobby into a career,
        I explored various education options. I decided to apply for a place at
        <a href="https://northcoders.com" target="_blank">Northcoders</a> on the
        advice of the IT recruitment manager at my previous workplace and
        learning what the course involved. I've found Northcoders to be one of
        the most rewarding times in my life and I'm amazed at how much I've
        learnt. (describe stuff I've learnt)
