          I built a system using MS Access for the Quality Assurance (QA) team
          at my previous workplace. The team monitors call centre agents and the
          quality of their calls, including soft skills and adherence to company
          policies and government/industry regulations, and scores them against
          the standard agreed upon by QA and department managers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data collection for this was done using Excel and due to there
          being different approaches to the monitoring and storing of
          information for each department, staff found it time consuming and
          difficult to keep track of the various files, maintain organisation of
          their workload, and produce reports based in the data being collected.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were two main aims of this system. Firstly, to consolidate all
          of the data so that it could be stored in a central location, and
          secondly, to provide an easy to use interface where the data could be
          submitted and accessed, and reports could be compiled.
        </p>

        <h4>
          I have included information on a selection of the system's features
          below:

        <p>
          The menu follows the user login screen which checks that the staff
          member is authorised to use the system. There are links to all the
          main areas and they are organised by utility.

          I used VBA to create the logic within the scorecards and calculate the
          scores based on the users selecting pass/fail/na in the drop down
          boxes, and referencing the 'points' for the sections. The points are
          weightings and so the final scores need to take into account the
          points total for the sections marked as applicable and then give a
          percentage based on the points totals for the passed/failed sections.
          It also provides percentages for the overall categories (soft skills,
          system use, etc) by referencing the section categories in the backend
          database.

        <p>
          I created a management information dashboard where the teams
          performance can be tracked across various KPI's all displayed in one
          place.

          This is an example of one of the reports produced by the system which
          uses an algorythm I created to calculate risk scores across
          departments and scorecard sections as well as providing information
          for trend analysis.

          This report drills down on the areas most in need for review and
          provides a more detailed historical analysis of performance over the
          previous 12 weeks for those areas.

          I included functionality such as this 'Amend Advisor' screen to give
          the team a user friendly interface for completing administrative tasks
          and therefore avoiding the need to navigate through the backend
          database.

          This screen allows the user to swap in and out areas to be focused on
          by clicking the check boxes. The team can use the filtering options on
          the table based on whichever criteria is deemed necessary at the time.
          The information in the top half of the screen updates dynamically
          based on selection of the check boxes. Being able to drill down in
          this way allows the team to report key themes to the Compliance &
          Regulation and Learning & Development departments, as well the
          individual department managers, in a more targeted and productive
          manner.
